    Here are a few of my personal favorites
</div>
<h4>
    Boeing 737-800
</h4>

<p>
    Originally built by boeing in the late 1990s with many still on order today the 800 variant of the 737 is a favorite among many players, it is the premier option for anything from a short flight to a transcontinental long haul. Handling is pleasant and easy.
    While the game limits it's speed at 330 KIAS before the overspeed alarm, a few changes to the config file will let you cruise at normal airline speeds without such difficulties.

<h4>
    Bombardier Canadair CRJ 700
</h4>
<img src="https://enacademic.com/pictures/enwiki/70/FSX-CRJ_700_landing_at_LLBG.PNG" alt="crj">
<p>
    A great regional jet, both fast and efficient. It's a clear first choice for short routes between cities, and a low touchdown speed around 125KIAS makes it ideal for shorter and less maintained runways.

<h4>
    Augusta Westland EH101
</h4>
<img src="http://www.fstipsandaddons.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/agusta-westland-eh101-right-side.jpg" alt="eh101">
<p>
    Multi purpose helicopter for both civilian and military usage, a favorite for landing at any type of remote site, on top of a building, on a road, and even on a runway.
