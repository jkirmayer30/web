        Here are a few of my personal favorites
    </div>
    <h4>
        Boeing 737-800
    </h4>
    <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/425981040242568247/192F9304352CBC9AF733CFC6694E5283FDD890C5/" alt="737">
    <p>
        Originally built by boeing in the late 1990s with many still on order today the 800 variant of the 737 is a favorite among many players, it is the premier option for anything from a short flight to a transcontinental long haul. Handling is pleasant and easy.
        While the game limits it's speed at 330 KIAS before the overspeed alarm, a few changes to the config file will let you cruise at normal airline speeds without such difficulties.

    <h4>
        Bombardier Canadair CRJ 700
    </h4>
    <img src="https://enacademic.com/pictures/enwiki/70/FSX-CRJ_700_landing_at_LLBG.PNG" alt="crj">
    <p>
        A great regional jet, both fast and efficient. It's a clear first choice for short routes between cities, and a low touchdown speed around 125KIAS makes it ideal for shorter and less maintained runways.

    <h4>
        Augusta Westland EH101
    </h4>
    <img src="http://www.fstipsandaddons.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/agusta-westland-eh101-right-side.jpg" alt="eh101">
    <p>
        Multi purpose helicopter for both civilian and military usage, a favorite for landing at any type of remote site, on top of a building, on a road, and even on a runway.

    <h2>
