	 <p>Faicobae: Faiyaz Rafee, Gitae Park, Jacob Kirmayer - Period 4 </p>
		 <p>We here at the Faicobae Organization decided to make an airline tracker because we are find airplanes extremely interesting.
		 We thought it would be fun to organize the provided data of currently flying airplanes all around the world.
		 Our site provided you with the altitude, the speed, the location, the origin ,the destination, plane type , the ETA and the current status.
		 The airline tracker is dynamic and constantly updated so it provides live data about current flights.
		 We also provide a picture of the particular plane you searched for. </p>
		 
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 Instructions: In order to use Airline Tracker, input the 2 letter IATA airline ID (NOT 3 LETTER VERSION) in the first box that says Airline ID (2 letter IATA):. Next insert the flight number in the second box that says Flight number:. Then press submit to get your desired data. Ex: If full ID is DL2442, insert DL into first box and 2442 into second box and press submit. 
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 <div>
		 <p>How the Airline Tracker works is that we take the inputs via a python library called CGI and then we reference it to a API called FlightRadar24. Then we retrieve and process information which is then displayed to the user via an html page hosted by moe.stuy.edu.</p>
		 </div>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 The python file is the Airline Tracker with its description above and the HTML file consists of the description of the Airline Tracker.(This page)
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 Resources used: FlightRadar24 API and CGI. We used FlightRadar24 API to get the raw live data of the flight requested by the user. We used CGI to get the inputs into our program.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 We have no bugs. One thing you should still be aware of is that we only accept the 2 letter IATA Airline ID since it is more commonly used the the 3 letter version. All airlines have both versions so if you find that you only have access to the 3 letter ICAO, google the 2 letter IATA counterpart.
		 Private planes also do not show up.
